[[101 Design Methods_ A Structured Approach for Driving Innovation in Your Organization ( PDFDrive ).pdf]]
## Phase 1: Sense Intent
### Motivation
- Understand in which direction the world is moving?
- In which sector, industry, and market does our organization intend to innovate?
- Figure out where to start. 

### Method
- [ ] take a pause and consider the changing world around us
- [ ] create a high-level views of the changes going on in the topic area
- [ ] Form speculations about what new situations may be looming on the horizon
- [ ] Gather the latest happenings, cutting-edge, developments, and latest news
- [ ] Monitor various information sources—periodicals, websites, books, broadcasts, podcasts—and opinions of leading experts  and thought leaders
- [ ] Look at the megatrends happening in business, technology, society, culture, policy
- [ ] Which sectors of the economy are growing and which are in decline?

### Mechanics

.....

### Message

- [ ] Outlining hypotheses of how the organization could take advantage of innovation  
opportunities
- [ ] Stating initial intent


## Phase 2: Understand Context

### Motivation
- [ ] Study the environment in which our innovation offerings (products, services,  
experiences, brands, etc.) exist or could exist.
- [ ] How do government policies and regulations affect our market?
- [ ] How do similar offerings to ours perform?

### Method 

- [ ] Ask experts: Understanding their analytics, opinions, and recommendations
- [ ] Look at all the competitors and their evolving strategies!
- [ ] Find emerging patterns
- [ ] Evolution Mapping: Creating overviews of key industry, developments, eras, timelines, and likely futures
- [ ] Doing comparisons: Creating overviews showing organizations in relation to industry networks,  competitors, and analogous organizations

**Hint: Make a Research Plan to split the work according to the existing ressource

## Phase 3: Understand People


### Motivation
- [ ] Who are the end users? Who are the stakeholders?
- [ ] What are their interactions in their daily lives?
- [ ] Explore a person’s unmet or unspoken needs!

### Method
-  Plan research: Deciding on research objectives, target users, fieldwork protocols, budgets, and timeframes
-  Observe people: Recruiting participants, doing fieldwork, documenting people, their activities, and  interactions with objects and environment  
- Ask People: Conduct surveys, discuss findings with users, and gathering feedback and  
validation  
- Engaging people: Having users participate in activities,  conversations, and interactions with researchers  
- Organizing finding: Collecting observations and  research data, tagging with keywords, and identifying gaps in research

### Message

## Phase 4: Frame Insights
### Motivation 
- Finding insights and patterns that repeatedly emerge from conducted data analysis
- Gain multiple perspectives of the context for a fuller understanding

### Method

-  Model systems: Diagramming the context as a system showing its components, relationships, attributes, and value flows
- Finding clusters: Sorting data in different ways, finding groupings, and revealing high-level insights  
- Finding patterns: Visualizing research findings as diagrams and revealing hot spots, gaps, and overlaps
- Making profiles: Defining attributes of key stakeholders and other parts of the system  
- Mapping flows: Visualizing how value flows in networks of producers, consumers, suppliers, and other stakeholders
- Mapping experiences: Diagramming user journeys in space and time, discovering pain points, and showing opportunities  
- Make frameworks: Summarizing insights and translating them into frameworks and guidelines to drive concept generation

### Message

## Phase 5:  Explore Concepts
### Motivation 

-  Identify opportunities and to explore new concepts
-  construct rough prototypes, either to focus team discussions or to get early user or client feedback.

**Take care:  Ensure that the concepts are defensible and grounded in reality

### Method

- Brainstorming
- Framing concept space: Converting insights to design principles, reframe assumptions, and making  hypotheses for concept generation  
- Defining concepts: Brainstorming concepts within the widest solution space permitted by design principles, gaining inspiration from metaphors, and visualizing concepts  
- Organizing concepts: Sorting, recombining, and  dividing concepts into logical systems and groups
- Collecting and archiving concepts for future reference  
- Communicating concepts: Sketching, diagramming, prototyping, visualizing, and narrating concepts to understand, validate, and convey their value

## Phase 6:  Frame Solutions
### Motivation 
- combining the concepts to systems, named “Solutions.
- Organize concepts and solutions into useful categories and hierarchies
	- evaluate concepts and identify the ones that bring the most value to stakeholders (primarily users and businesses).


### Method
- Generating options: Combining the many point concepts explored in Phase 6 into a set of solution options for further selection.
- Systematizing concepts: Clustering and synthesizing  concepts into coherent systems, planning lifecycles of offerings, and creating roadmaps  
- Evaluating concepts: Scoring, voting, and ranking concepts against design principles, cost/benefit, viability, and feasibility  
- Communicating solutions: Refining sketches, diagrams, prototypes, visualizations, and narratives of proposed solutions  
- Organizing solutions: Sorting, collecting, and archiving solutions for easy access, including use by other teams and projects
- iteratively prototype solutions, and test them in realworld settings

### Mechanics

....

### Message
- most valuable concepts are combined into systems of concepts that work together


## Phase 7:  Realize Offering
### Motivation
- Evaluate Prototypes to move on to implementation
- Make sure that solutions are built around peoples’ experiences and can provide real value for the customer
- Make sure that these solutions add economic value for the organizations producing them
-  Identify the key activities necessary to implement the solution

### Method
- Building prototypes: Developing prototypes to test details, feasibility, viability, and technical specifications  
- Defining strategies: Determining market positioning, platforms, partners, and business plans key to the innovation’s success  
- Defining tactics: Identifying capabilities necessary to achieve strategies and plan development trajectory
- Developing initiatives: Gathering resources, constructing budgets and schedules, hiring teams, and creating plans for pilots and launches
